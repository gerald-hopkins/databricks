Databricks Songs Data Engineering Sample

In this repo, you'll find my code to use in Databricks notebooks to:

- connect to the Databricks onboard out-of-the-box music sample dataset
- profile the data for schema and transformations
- load the data into a raw delta table
- transform the data and load into a prepared table for BI
- analyze the data (analyze-songs-prepared.py)
